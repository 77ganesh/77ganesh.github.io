This year was pretty exciting!

I switched jobs, moved to a new city, started new things like swimming, gym, waking up early, keeping a journal, moving a bit outside my introverted comfort zone all the while without compromising on existing hobbies.

I want to highlight 3 take-aways in my 2019.

1. Human body is weak
I was bedridden for 7+ days this year. During those 7 days, normal activities were extremely difficult and it completely threw me off my schedule. It is extremely important to take care of oneself.

2. There is only 24 hours per day
No matter how perfectly you plan, there will be surprises and its always good to keep a keen eye on how you want to spend our time.

3. Recognize and remove negative people
I have a lot of positive people in my life. But despite that, the impact the few negative people had was no joke. Understand, learn to say no and free yourselves.

One of the things that had a big impact on me this year was the book titled 1984. For something written in the 1950s, this is a satirical masterpiece which not only predicts how the future world in 30 years would be but also shocking close to the world we live in right now. It was a thought-provoking, intense yet funny book. Definitely a must read for anyone and everyone.
