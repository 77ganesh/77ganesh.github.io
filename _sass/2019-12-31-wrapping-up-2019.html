<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">This year was pretty exciting!<br /><br />I switched jobs, moved to a new city, started new things like swimming, gym, waking up early, keeping a journal, moving a bit outside my introverted comfort zone all the while without compromising on existing hobbies.<br /><br /><br /></div><div style="height: 0; padding-bottom: 75%; position: relative; width: 100%;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" class="giphy-embed" frameborder="0" height="100%" src="https://giphy.com/embed/pa37AAGzKXoek" style="position: absolute;" width="100%"></iframe> </div><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/dancing-fresh-prince-of-bel-air-carlton-pa37AAGzKXoek">via GIPHY</a><br /><br />I want to highlight 3 take-aways in my 2019.<br /><br />1. Human body is weak<br />I was bedridden for 7+ days this year. During those 7 days, normal activities were extremely difficult and it completely threw me off my schedule. It is extremely important to take care of oneself.<br /><br />2. There is only 24 hours per day<br />No matter how perfectly you plan, there will be surprises and its always good to keep a keen eye on how you want to spend our time. <br /><br />3. Recognize and remove negative people<br />I have a lot of positive people in my life. But despite that, the impact the few negative people had was no joke. Understand, learn to say no and free yourselves.<br /><br />One of the things that had a big impact on me this year was the book titled 1984. For something written in the 1950s, this is a satirical masterpiece which not only predicts how the future world in 30 years would be but also shocking close to the world we live in right now. It was a thought-provoking, intense yet funny book. Definitely a must read for anyone and everyone.<br /><br />"Perhaps people did not want to be loved as much as understood"<br />- 1984, George Orwell</div>
